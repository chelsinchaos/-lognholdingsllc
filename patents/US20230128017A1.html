        <h3>Background/Summary</h3>
        <p id="relatedApplications">RELATED APPLICATION(S)
[0001] This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application Nos. 63/256,267 filed on 15 Oct. 2021, and 63/272,539 filed on 27 Oct. 2021, the entire contents of which are incorporated herein by reference.</p>
        <p id="technicalField">TECHNICAL FIELD<br>[0002] This disclosure relates to data encoding and, more particularly, to systems and methods that allow for the processing of encoded data without the need for decoding.<br>BACKGROUND<br>[0003] Data may be encoded and decoded to transform the data from a first form to a second form to achieve a certain task. One example of such encoding may be data compression, wherein data is transformed from a first form (e.g., a larger form) to a second form (e.g., a smaller form) to achieve the task of saving storage space. Another example of such encoding may be data encryption, wherein data is transformed from a first form (e.g., an unencrypted form) to a second form (e.g., an encrypted form) to achieve the task of securing the data.<br>[0004] Unfortunately and when using such encoded data (e.g., accessing the data, manipulating the data), the encoded data would first need to be decoded (e.g., decompressed/decrypted), then used (e.g., accessed/manipulated), and then reencoded (compressed/encrypted). As could be imagined, such decoding and subsequent reencoding is expensive from a computational and availability point of view.<br>SUMMARY OF DISCLOSURE<br>ENCODED DATA (IN PROCESS)<br>[0005] In one implementation, a computer-implemented method is executed on a computing device and includes: processing an unencoded data file to identify a plurality of file segments; mapping each of the plurality of file segments to a portion of a dictionary file to generate a plurality of mappings that each include a starting location and a length, thus generating a related encoded data file based, at least in part, upon the plurality of mappings; receiving a request to manipulate the unencoded data file; and processing the related encoded data file based, at least in part, upon the plurality of mappings and the dictionary file to generate a modified encoded data file that represents the requested manipulations of the unencoded data file.<br>[0006] One or more of the following features may be included. Processing the related encoded data file based, at least in part, upon the plurality of mappings and the dictionary file to generate a modified encoded data file that represents the requested manipulations of the unencoded data file may include one or more of: performing a homomorphic encoding operation; and performing a heteromorphic encoding operation. The related encoded data file may include one or more of: a related compressed data file; and a related encrypted data file. The dictionary file may include a plurality of discrete entries. Processing the related encoded data file based, at least in part, upon the plurality of mappings and the dictionary file to generate a modified encoded data file that represents the requested manipulations of the unencoded data file may include: processing the related encoded data file, in a byte-wise fashion, based upon the plurality of mappings and the dictionary file to generate a modified encoded data file that represents the requested manipulations of the unencoded data file. The dictionary file may include a plurality of concatenated entries. Processing the related encoded data file based, at least in part, upon the plurality of mappings and the dictionary file to generate a modified encoded data file that represents the requested manipulations of the unencoded data file may include: processing the related encoded data file, in a bit-wise fashion, based upon the plurality of mappings and the dictionary file to generate a modified encoded data file that represents the requested manipulations of the unencoded data file. The requested manipulations may concern one or more of: a computation operation; a search operation; an append operation; a splitting operation; a joining operation; and a concatenating operation. The related encoded data file may be more easily processable than the unencoded data file. The related encoded data file may require less computational overhead than the unencoded data file.<br>[0007] In another implementation, a computer program product resides on a computer readable medium and has a plurality of instructions stored on it. When executed by a processor, the instructions cause the processor to perform operations including: processing an unencoded data file to identify a plurality of file segments; mapping each of the plurality of file segments to a portion of a dictionary file to generate a plurality of mappings that each include a starting location and a length, thus generating a related encoded data file based, at least in part, upon the plurality of mappings; receiving a request to manipulate the unencoded data file; and processing the related encoded data file based, at least in part, upon the plurality of mappings and the dictionary file to generate a modified encoded data file that represents the requested manipulations of the unencoded data file.<br>[0008] One or more of the following features may be included. Processing the related encoded data file based, at least in part, upon the plurality of mappings and the dictionary file to generate a modified encoded data file that represents the requested manipulations of the unencoded data file may include one or more of: performing a homomorphic encoding operation; and performing a heteromorphic encoding operation. The related encoded data file may include one or more of: a related compressed data file; and a related encrypted data file. The dictionary file may include a plurality of discrete entries. Processing the related encoded data file based, at least in part, upon the plurality of mappings and the dictionary file to generate a modified encoded data file that represents the requested manipulations of the unencoded data file may include: processing the related encoded data file, in a byte-wise fashion, based upon the plurality of mappings and the dictionary file to generate a modified encoded data file that represents the requested manipulations of the unencoded data file. The dictionary file may include a plurality of concatenated entries. Processing the related encoded data file based, at least in part, upon the plurality of mappings and the dictionary file to generate a modified encoded data file that represents the requested manipulations of the unencoded data file may include: processing the related encoded data file, in a bit-wise fashion, based upon the plurality of mappings and the dictionary file to generate a modified encoded data file that represents the requested manipulations of the unencoded data file. The requested manipulations may concern one or more of: a computation operation; a search operation; an append operation; a splitting operation; a joining operation; and a concatenating operation. The related encoded data file may be more easily processable than the unencoded data file. The related encoded data file may require less computational overhead than the unencoded data file.<br>[0009] In another implementation, a computing system includes a processor and memory is configured to perform operations including: processing an unencoded data file to identify a plurality of file segments; mapping each of the plurality of file segments to a portion of a dictionary file to generate a plurality of mappings that each include a starting location and a length, thus generating a related encoded data file based, at least in part, upon the plurality of mappings; receiving a request to manipulate the unencoded data file; and processing the related encoded data file based, at least in part, upon the plurality of mappings and the dictionary file to generate a modified encoded data file that represents the requested manipulations of the unencoded data file.<br>[0010] One or more of the following features may be included. Processing the related encoded data file based, at least in part, upon the plurality of mappings and the dictionary file to generate a modified encoded data file that represents the requested manipulations of the unencoded data file may include one or more of: performing a homomorphic encoding operation; and performing a heteromorphic encoding operation.

Examples of storage devices <b>20</b>, <b>22</b>, <b>24</b>, <b>26</b> may include but are not limited to: hard disk drives; RAID devices; random access memories (RAM); read-only memories (ROM), and all forms of flash memory storage devices.<br>[0037] Examples of client electronic devices <b>28</b>, <b>30</b>, <b>32</b>, <b>34</b> may include, but are not limited to, a smartphone (not shown), a personal digital assistant (not shown), a tablet computer (not shown), laptop computers <b>28</b>, <b>30</b>, <b>32</b>, personal computer <b>34</b>, a notebook computer (not shown), a server computer (not shown), a gaming console (not shown), and a dedicated network device (not shown). Client electronic devices <b>28</b>, <b>30</b>, <b>32</b>, <b>34</b> may each execute an operating system, examples of which may include but are not limited to Microsoft Windows?, Android?, iOS?, Linux?, or a custom operating system.<br>[0038] Users <b>36</b>, <b>38</b>, <b>40</b>, <b>42</b> may access encoding/decoding process <b>10</b> directly through network <b>14</b> or through secondary network <b>18</b>. Further, encoding/decoding process <b>10</b> may be connected to network <b>14</b> through secondary network <b>18</b>, as illustrated with link line <b>44</b>.<br>[0039] The various client electronic devices (e.g., client electronic devices <b>28</b>, <b>30</b>, <b>32</b>, <b>34</b>) may be directly or indirectly coupled to network <b>14</b> (or network <b>18</b>). For example, laptop computer <b>28</b> and laptop computer <b>30</b> are shown wirelessly coupled to network <b>14</b> via wireless communication channels <b>44</b>, <b>46</b> (respectively) established between laptop computers <b>28</b>, <b>30</b> (respectively) and cellular network/bridge <b>48</b>, which is shown directly coupled to network <b>14</b>. Further, laptop computer <b>32</b> is shown wirelessly coupled to network <b>14</b> via wireless communication channel <b>50</b> established between laptop computer <b>32</b> and wireless access point (i.e., WAP) <b>52</b>, which is shown directly coupled to network <b>14</b>. Additionally, personal computer <b>34</b> is shown directly coupled to network <b>18</b> via a hardwired network connection.<br>[0040] WAP <b>52</b> may be, for example, an IEEE 802.11a, 802.11b, 802.11g, 802.11n, Wi-Fi, and/or Bluetooth device that is capable of establishing wireless communication channel <b>50</b> between laptop computer <b>32</b> and WAP <b>52</b>. As is known in the art, IEEE 802.11x specifications may use Ethernet protocol and carrier sense multiple access with collision avoidance (i.e., CSMA/CA) for path sharing. As is known in the art, Bluetooth is a telecommunications industry specification that allows e.g., mobile phones, computers, and personal digital assistants to be interconnected using a short-range wireless connection.<br>Encoding/Decoding Process<br>[0041] Referring also to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> and as will be discussed below in greater detail, encoding/decoding process <b>10</b> may be configured to allow for the encoding and subsequent decoding of data (e.g., first data file <b>100</b>). Examples of such encoding/decoding may include but are not limited to: compression/decompression and encryption/decryption. Further and as will be discussed below in greater detail, encoding/decoding process <b>10</b> may be configured to allow for the manipulation of such encoded data (e.g., compressed data and/or encrypted data) without the need to first decode (e.g., decompress and/or decrypt) the encoded data. [0042] Compression/Decompression: As is known in the art, data compression (or source coding or bit-rate reduction) is the process of encoding information using fewer bits than the original representation. Any particular compression is either lossy or lossless. Lossless compression reduces bits by identifying and eliminating statistical redundancy. No information is lost in lossless compression. Lossy compression reduces bits by removing unnecessary or less important information. Typically, a device that performs data compression is referred to as an encoder, and one that performs the reversal of the process (decompression) as a decoder. The process of reducing the size of a data file is often referred to as data compression. In the context of data transmission, it is called source coding; encoding done at the source of the data before it is stored or transmitted. Compression is useful because it reduces the resources required to store and transmit data. Computational resources are consumed in the compression and decompression processes. Data compression is subject to a space—time complexity trade-off. For instance, a compression scheme for video may require expensive hardware for the video to be decompressed fast enough to be viewed as it is being decompressed, and the option to decompress the video in full before watching it may be inconvenient or require additional storage. The design of data compression schemes involves trade-offs among various factors, including the degree of compression, the amount of distortion introduced (when using lossy data compression), and the computational resources required to compress and decompress the data. [0043] Encryption/Decryption: As is known in the art, data encryption is the process of encoding information, wherein the process converts the original representation of the information (known as plaintext), into an alternative form (known as ciphertext). Ideally, only authorized parties can decipher a ciphertext back to plaintext and access the original information. Encryption does not itself prevent interference but denies the intelligible content to a would-be interceptor. For technical reasons, an encryption scheme usually uses a pseudo-random encryption key generated by an algorithm. It is possible to decrypt the message without possessing the key but, for a well-designed encryption scheme, considerable computational resources and skills are required. An authorized recipient can easily decrypt the message with the key provided by the originator to recipients but not to unauthorized users. Historically, various forms of encryption have been used to aid in cryptography. Early encryption techniques were often used in military messaging. Since then, new techniques have emerged and become commonplace in all areas of modern computing. Modern encryption schemes use the concepts of public-key and symmetric-key and may ensure security because modern computers are inefficient at cracking the encryption.<br>SYSTEM OVERVIEW<br>[0044] The following discussion concerns a system overview of encoding/decoding process <b>10</b>.<br>[0045] Referring also to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, encoding/decoding process <b>10</b> may encode <b>200</b> a first data file (e.g., first data file <b>100</b>) to generate a related encoded data file (e.g., related encoded data file <b>102</b>) based, at least in part, upon a plurality of mappings (e.g., plurality of mappings <b>104</b>) to a plurality of portions of a dictionary file (e.g., dictionary file <b>106</b>).<br>[0046] This first data file (e.g., first data file <b>100</b>) may essentially be any type of data file, examples of which may include but are not limited to: a first compressed data file; a first uncompressed data file; a first encrypted data file; a first unencrypted data file; a first encoded data file; and a first unencoded data file.<br>[0047] As will be discussed below in greater detail, each of the plurality of mappings (e.g., plurality of mappings <b>104</b>) may include a starting location and a length that points to a particular portion of the dictionary file (e.g., dictionary file <b>106</b>).

In the example described above, the sampling window is four bits. However, this is for illustrative purposes only and is not intended to be a limitation of this disclosure, as other configurations are possible and are considered to be within the scope of this disclosure.

It is a fast and simple action, basic to the higher-level arithmetic operations and directly supported by the processor. Most bit-wise operations are presented as two-operand instructions where the result replaces one of the input operands. Conversely, a byte-wise operation operates on a bit string, a bit array or a binary numeral (considered as a bit string) at the level of bytes (i.e., a group of bits). On simple low-cost processors, typically, bit-wise operations are substantially faster than division, several times faster than multiplication, and sometimes significantly faster than addition. While modern processors usually perform addition and multiplication just as fast as bit-wise operations due to their longer instruction pipelines and other architectural design choices, bit-wise operations do commonly use less power because of the reduced use of resources.<br>HIGH-LEVEL SYSTEM<br>[0122] The following discussion concerns a more focused view of encoding/decoding process <b>10</b>.

Structured data conforms to a tabular format with relationship between the different rows and columns. Common examples of structured data are Excel files or SQL databases. Each of these have structured rows and columns that can be sorted. Structured data depends on the existence of a data model—a model of how data can be stored, processed and accessed. Because of a data model, each field is discrete and can be accessed separately or jointly along with data from other fields. This makes structured data extremely powerful: it is possible to quickly aggregate data from various locations in the database.<br>[0285] As in known in the art, unstructured data is information that either does not have a predefined data model or is not organized in a pre-defined manner. Unstructured information is typically text-heavy, but may contain data such as dates, numbers, and facts as well. This results in irregularities and ambiguities that make it difficult to understand using traditional programs as compared to data stored in structured databases. Common examples of unstructured data include audio, video files or No-SQL databases. The ability to store and process unstructured data has greatly grown in recent years, with many new technologies and tools coming to the market that are able to store specialized types of unstructured data. MongoDB, for example, is optimized to store documents.

It is seen as a part of artificial intelligence. Machine learning algorithms build a model based on sample data, known as training data, in order to make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed to do so. Machine learning algorithms are used in a wide variety of applications, such as in medicine, email filtering, speech recognition, and computer vision, where it is difficult or unfeasible to develop conventional algorithms to perform the needed tasks.<br>[0333] A subset of machine learning is closely related to computational statistics, which focuses on making predictions using computers, but not all machine learning is statistical learning. The study of mathematical optimization delivers methods, theory and application domains to the field of machine learning. Data mining is a related field of study, focusing on exploratory data analysis through unsupervised learning. Some implementations of machine learning use data and neural networks in a way that mimics the working of a biological brain. In its application across business problems, machine learning is also referred to as predictive analytics.<br>[0334] As is known in the art, a machine learning system or model may generally include an algorithm or combination of algorithms that has been trained to recognize certain types of patterns. For example, machine learning approaches may be generally divided into three categories, depending on the nature of the signal available: supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning. As is known in the art, supervised learning may include presenting a computing device with example inputs and their desired outputs, given by a “teacher”, where the goal is to learn a general rule that maps inputs to outputs. With unsupervised learning, no labels are given to the learning algorithm, leaving it on its own to find structure in its input. Unsupervised learning can be a goal in itself (discovering hidden patterns in data) or a means towards an end (feature learning). As is known in the art, reinforcement learning may generally include a computing device interacting in a dynamic environment in which it must perform a certain goal (such as driving a vehicle or playing a game against an opponent). As the machine learning system navigates its problem space, the machine learning system is provided feedback that's analogous to rewards, which it tries to maximize. While three examples of machine learning approaches have been provided, it will be appreciated that other machine learning approaches are possible within the scope of the present disclosure.<br>[0335] Encoding/decoding process <b>10</b> may map <b>852</b> each of the plurality of file segments (e.g., plurality of file segments <b>112</b>) to a portion of a dictionary file (e.g., dictionary file <b>106</b>) to generate a plurality of mappings (e.g., plurality of mappings <b>104</b>) that each include a starting location and a length, thus generating a related encoded data file (e.g., related encoded data file <b>102</b>) based, at least in part, upon the plurality of mappings (e.g., plurality of mappings <b>104</b>).<br>[0336] As discussed above, one example of such mappings may include but is not limited to: [0337] a first mapping &lt;28/4&gt; that defines an offset of 28 bits from the beginning of dictionary file <b>106</b> and a read length of 4 bits, thus mapping to 0111 within dictionary file <b>106</b>; [0338] a second mapping &lt;44/4&gt; that defines an offset of 44 bits from the beginning of dictionary file <b>106</b> and a read length of 4 bits, thus mapping to 1011 within dictionary file <b>106</b>; [0339] a third mapping &lt;36/4&gt; that defines an offset of 36 bits from the beginning of dictionary file <b>106</b> and a read length of 4 bits, thus mapping to 1001 within dictionary file <b>106</b>; and [0340] a fourth mapping &lt;60/4&gt; that defines an offset of 60 bits from the beginning of dictionary file <b>106</b> and a read length of 4 bits, thus mapping to 1111 within dictionary file <b>106</b>.<br>[0341] Accordingly and in this example, the related encoded data file (e.g., related encoded data file <b>102</b>) may include four mappings (e.g., &lt;28/4&gt; &lt;44/4&gt; &lt;36/4&gt; &lt;60/4&gt;).

Each block contains a cryptographic hash of the previous block, a timestamp, and transaction data (generally represented as a Merkle tree, where data nodes are represented by leaves). The timestamp proves that the transaction data existed when the block was created. Since each block contains information about the block previous to it, they effectively form a chain (compare linked list data structure), with each additional block linking to the ones before it. Consequently, blockchain transactions are irreversible in that, once they are recorded, the data in any given block cannot be altered retroactively without altering all subsequent blocks.<br>[0371] Encoding/decoding process <b>10</b> may map <b>952</b> each of the plurality of file segments (e.g., plurality of file segments <b>112</b>) to a portion of a dictionary file (e.g., dictionary file <b>106</b>) to generate a plurality of mappings (e.g., plurality of mappings <b>104</b>) that each include a starting location and a length, thus generating a related encoded data file (e.g., related encoded data file <b>102</b>) based, at least in part, upon the plurality of mappings (e.g., plurality of mappings <b>104</b>).<br>[0372] As discussed above, one example of such mappings may include but is not limited to: [0373] a first mapping &lt;28/4&gt; that defines an offset of 28 bits from the beginning of dictionary file <b>106</b> and a read length of 4 bits, thus mapping to 0111 within dictionary file <b>106</b>; [0374] a second mapping &lt;44/4&gt; that defines an offset of 44 bits from the beginning of dictionary file <b>106</b> and a read length of 4 bits, thus mapping to 1011 within dictionary file <b>106</b>; [0375] a third mapping &lt;36/4&gt; that defines an offset of 36 bits from the beginning of dictionary file <b>106</b> and a read length of 4 bits, thus mapping to 1001 within dictionary file <b>106</b>; and [0376] a fourth mapping &lt;60/4&gt; that defines an offset of 60 bits from the beginning of dictionary file <b>106</b> and a read length of 4 bits, thus mapping to 1111 within dictionary file <b>106</b>.<br>[0377] Accordingly and in this example, the related encoded data file (e.g., related encoded data file <b>102</b>) may include four mappings (e.g., &lt;28/4&gt; &lt;44/4&gt; &lt;36/4&gt; &lt;60/4&gt;).

As discussed above, related encoded data file <b>102</b> may be a compressed data file, resulting in related encoded data file <b>102</b> being smaller in size than first data file <b>100</b>.

Referring also to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>19</b></figref>, encoding/decoding process <b>10</b> may process <b>1000</b> an unencoded data file (e.g., first data file <b>100</b>) to identify a plurality of file segments (e.g., plurality of file segments <b>112</b>). The unencoded data file (e.g., first data file <b>100</b>) may be a dataset for use with a disaster recovery process (e.g., disaster recovery process <b>134</b>).<br>[0386] As discussed in the example above, this first data file (e.g., first data file <b>100</b>) is:<br><br><!--?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?-->0111 1011 1001 1111<!--?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?--><br>[0387] Accordingly and in this example, plurality of file segments <b>112</b> includes four file segments, namely a) 0111, b) 1011, c) 1001 and d) 1111.<br>[0388] Disaster recovery involves a set of policies, tools, and procedures to enable the recovery or continuation of vital technology infrastructure and systems following a natural or human-induced disaster. Disaster recovery focuses on the information technology (IT) or technology systems supporting critical business functions as opposed to business continuity. This involves keeping all essential aspects of a business functioning despite significant disruptive events; it can therefore be considered a subset of business continuity. Disaster recovery assumes that the primary site is not recoverable for some time and represents a process of restoring data and services to a secondary survived site, which is opposite to restoring it back to its original place.<br>[0389] Encoding/decoding process <b>10</b> may map <b>1002</b> each of the plurality of file segments (e.g., plurality of file segments <b>112</b>) to a portion of a dictionary file (e.g., dictionary file <b>106</b>) to generate a plurality of mappings (e.g., plurality of mappings <b>104</b>) that each include a starting location and a length, thus generating a related encoded data file (e.g., related encoded data file <b>102</b>) based, at least in part, upon the plurality of mappings (e.g., plurality of mappings <b>104</b>).<br>[0390] As discussed above, one example of such mappings may include but is not limited to: [0391] a first mapping &lt;28/4&gt; that defines an offset of 28 bits from the beginning of dictionary file <b>106</b> and a read length of 4 bits, thus mapping to 0111 within dictionary file <b>106</b>; [0392] a second mapping &lt;44/4&gt; that defines an offset of 44 bits from the beginning of dictionary file <b>106</b> and a read length of 4 bits, thus mapping to 1011 within dictionary file <b>106</b>; [0393] a third mapping &lt;36/4&gt; that defines an offset of 36 bits from the beginning of dictionary file <b>106</b> and a read length of 4 bits, thus mapping to 1001 within dictionary file <b>106</b>; and [0394] a fourth mapping &lt;60/4&gt; that defines an offset of 60 bits from the beginning of dictionary file <b>106</b> and a read length of 4 bits, thus mapping to 1111 within dictionary file <b>106</b>.<br>[0395] Accordingly and in this example, the related encoded data file (e.g., related encoded data file <b>102</b>) may include four mappings (e.g., &lt;28/4&gt; &lt;44/4&gt; &lt;36/4&gt; &lt;60/4&gt;). One example of the related encoded data file (e.g., related encoded data file <b>102</b>) may include a recovery data set for use with the disaster recovery process (e.g., disaster recovery process <b>134</b>).<br>[0396] This related encoded data file (e.g., related encoded data file <b>102</b>) may be more easily processable and/or require less computational overhead than the unencoded data file (e.g., first data file <b>100</b>).

In the example discussed above, the request (e.g., request <b>160</b>) received <b>1004</b> concerned adding twenty-seven to first data file <b>100</b>.<br>[0398] Encoding/decoding process <b>10</b> may process <b>1006</b> the related encoded data file (e.g., related encoded data file <b>102</b>) based, at least in part, upon the plurality of mappings (e.g., plurality of mappings <b>104</b>) and the dictionary file (e.g., dictionary file <b>106</b>) to generate a modified encoded data file (e.g., modified encoded data file <b>108</b>) that represents the requested manipulations of the unencoded data file (e.g., first data file <b>100</b>).
